# Chirp It Up, Full Stack Style!
The purpose of this lab is to take your chirpr schema, connect it to your Chirper Half Stack app, and utilize the database instead of chirpsstore.ts or chirps.json!

# Required Steps
 ## Database
* Create a database user named chirprapp
* Grant all privileges to your chirpr database.
Hint: use chirpr.* in the ON part of the GRANT statement.
 ## Node
* In your chirpr API, use your database to store chirps instead of a file
* Install and save the mysql @types/mysql NodeJS package using NPM
* Configure your connection using createConnection
* In each API method, make the appropriate database call to create, read, update, and delete chirps
* Test all the REST API endpoints in Postman to confirm they all work
## React
 * Adjust your frontend React components to use the same API endpoints from above to achieve the same functionality it had reading a json file. It should display all chirps, view one chirp, delete or edit that, and the ability to add new chirps.
